# Bat Files (Character Leveling)
## Problem
When testing a quest or location mod for Skyrim SE you will often want to COC (Center on Cell) to a location from the main menu to reduce loading/travel time. This results in a level 1 (new) character. 

## Solution
Here are bat files which provide:
- Level 30 Orc-like warrior chracter with associated armour, weapons and skills(Two Handed, Heavy Armour, Smithing, Block)
- Level 30 High Elf-like Mage chracter with associated clothes, weapons, spells and skills (All Spell Classes)
- Level 252 "Chaos God" - Max Level, All Skills. Eqiped with high level gear and a good selection of known buggy spells, items and weapons. 
  - Intentionally designed as a toolkit to test niche bugs and edge cases

### How to use
1. Add the .bat files in this folder to your main Skyrim install directory. (e.g Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition if installed via Steam)
2. Load up Skyrim, get into the world
3. Open your console and run bat filname. E.g.
```
bat orcwarrior
```
